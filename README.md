Project: Quantum Blockchain Integration

Description:
This project demonstrates the integration of quantum computing concepts into a blockchain-like structure. The code showcases the simulation of mining qubits using real quantum hardware provided by IBM Quantum Experience, and how these qubits can be stored in a blockchain-inspired manner.

Key Features:
- Mining qubits using IBM Quantum Experience's real hardware.
- Storing mined qubits in a simulated blockchain structure.
- Validating the blockchain and detecting tampering.
- Demonstrating proof of work using quantum concepts.

Prerequisites:
- Python (version X.X.X)
- Qiskit (version X.X.X)
- IBM Quantum Experience account

Usage:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using 'pip install qiskit' (or use a virtual environment).
3. Open and modify the code to replace 'example_wallet_address' with your desired wallet address.
4. Execute the code in a Python environment.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to see the simulation in action.

Results:
- Successfully executed quantum mining and stored qubits.
- Demonstrated the integration of quantum computing and blockchain-inspired concepts.
- Proof of work and blockchain validation.

Note: This is a simulation for educational and experimental purposes only. It is not a full-fledged blockchain network.
