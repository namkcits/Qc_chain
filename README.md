# Quantum Mining and Blockchain Integration

Welcome to the Quantum Mining and Blockchain Integration project! This open-source codebase explores the fusion of quantum computing and blockchain technology to create an innovative approach to data security and integrity.

## Overview

This project combines the power of quantum operations with blockchain's tamper-resistant nature to enhance the security and reliability of digital data. The core concept is "Quantum Mining," where qubits are generated using quantum gates and added to a blockchain to form a secure, immutable ledger.

## Features

- Quantum Mining: Generate qubits using quantum operations (gates) to ensure ultra-secure data transactions.
- Blockchain Integration: Incorporate mined qubits into a blockchain for tamper-proof data storage and verification.
- Proof of Work: Implement a simple Proof of Work mechanism to secure the blockchain.
- Dynamic Matrix Operations: Customize quantum gates using dynamic matrix operations.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-blockchain.git
   cd quantum-blockchain
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies. This project uses Qiskit for quantum operations:
   ```
   pip install qiskit
   ```

3. Explore the codebase:
   - `qc_chain.py`: Contains the QCChain class responsible for quantum mining.
   - `blockchain.py`: Defines the Block and Blockchain classes for blockchain integration.
   - `main.py`: Run this script to mine qubits, create blockchain blocks, and validate the chain.

## Usage

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the quantum mining and blockchain integration process:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to mine qubits, create blockchain blocks, and validate the blockchain's integrity.
